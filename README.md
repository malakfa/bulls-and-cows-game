The program will generate a four-digit number with no repeated digits, which the user will attempt to guess. After each guess, the program will display the number and provide the following feedback: the number of digits that match exactly and the number of digits that appear in the original number but in a different location .

The user will make guesses to uncover the four-digit number generated by the program. The game will continue until the user correctly guesses the number, at which point the total number of guesses will be displayed. After the game ends, the user will be prompted with a dialog box asking if they would like to play a new game..
